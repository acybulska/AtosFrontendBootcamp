Creating http protocols application

Last commit:
Due to absence at the Monday workshop, I had no idea how to test my application so after long search I gave up. I can do everything including backend to make that up. (No idea how to mock backend in node although I did try). It was after 4 PM I finally could do it so this is why I haven't asked anyone.
